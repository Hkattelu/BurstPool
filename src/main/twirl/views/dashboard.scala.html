          <h3> Pool Information </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Miners should submit nonces to port 8124. This pool also supports the
             getMiningInfo API call on the same port.</li>
            <li>To mine here you need to set your "reward recipient" to
             BURST-SPAC-EWWF-CRX2-78Z6Z. This costs 1 BURST and you need to wait 4
              blocks before it takes effect</li>
            <li>Transaction fees are included in the rewards shared to miners. When the
             pool wins a block, 2% is deducted from the block reward for pool usage 
             fees. Of the remaining reward, 60% is shared over miners who submitted 
             nonces for the current block. For the current block, a miner's share of the 
             (60%) reward is inversely proportional to (deadline + 1)1.2. The other 40% 
             is shared over miners who submitted nonces for the previous 500 blocks. 
             These "historic" shares are simply the average of "current" shares over the 
             previous 500 blocks.</li>
            <li>Miner payouts are calculated after a minimum of 10 blocks after the pool 
              wins that block. Miner payouts are Deferred until their total pending 
              payout is at least 250 BURST, or the earliest pending payout is over 2520 
              blocks old. Queued payouts are waiting to be sent to the BURST network. 
              Unconfirmed payouts have been sent to the BURST network but haven't had 10 
              confirmations yet. Confirmed payouts are listed as Paid. If there are no 
              unconfirmed payouts, and no blocks won by the pool which haven't been 
              shared out yet, then the balance, minus deferred payouts, is swept into 
              the pool's fee account.</li>
